        Welcome to the Digital Carbon Footprint Inquiry. At the Barnard DHC, we are commited to sustainability.
        We want to understanding harm to our environment not from
        the perspective of individual responsibility but by "practicing on being in right
        relationship to our home and each other" (adrienne maree brown, 24). We present this tool
        not to evaluate or critique the impacts of our digital use, but rather to learn and inspire
        critical reflection and relationships that can get us closer to "the 'right relationship'" width
        the natural world that adrienne maree brown describes with centering collaboration between
        ecosystems and lifeforms.

        How about the instances of natural networks that survive and grow despite
        our human impact? What can we learn from these sustainable relationships and
        connections? Might we embody them and care for them? Working within adrienne
        maree brownâ€™s emergent strategy framework, we present this tool as a way to attend to
        the small actions implicated in these larger networks and the change that is
        created by this interconnectedness.
