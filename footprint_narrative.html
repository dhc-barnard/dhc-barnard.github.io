          <p> Welcome to the Digital Carbon Footprint Inquiry. At the Barnard DHC, we are commited to sustainability. We
            want to understanding harm to our environment not from the perspective of individual responsibility but by
            <q>practicing on being in right relationship to our home and each other</q> (adrienne maree brown, 24). We
            present this tool not to evaluate or critique the impacts of our digital use, but rather to learn and
            inspire critical reflection and relationships that can get us closer to <q>the 'right relationship'</q>
            width the natural world that adrienne maree brown describes with centering collaboration between ecosystems
            and lifeforms.
          </p>

          <p>How about the instances of natural networks that survive and grow despite our human impact? What can we
            learn from these sustainable relationships and connections? Might we embody them and care for them? Working
            within adrienne maree brown’s emergent strategy framework, we present this tool as a way to attend to the
            small actions implicated in these larger networks and the change that is created by this interconnectedness
